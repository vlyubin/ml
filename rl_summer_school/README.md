# Reinforcement Learning Summer School

Some simple RL algorithms used to solve OpenAI gym problems (and extra excercises), that include:

* Bandit algorithms (stock picking)
* Conditional Expectation Maximization (cart pole)
* Natural Evolution Strategy (cart pole)
* Sarsa (frozen lake)
* Q learning (frozen lake)
